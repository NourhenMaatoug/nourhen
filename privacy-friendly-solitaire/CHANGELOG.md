## [Privacy Friendly Solitaire v1.0](https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-solitaire/releases/tag/v1.0) - 07 Mar 2018

Privacy Friendly Solitiare is a Klondike Solitiare Game. Its goal is to move all cards to the foundations. A detailed description of the rules can be found in the app's help site.

The app provides different difficulty levels that optionally draw either one or three cards from the deck. Additionally there are the following versions of counting points:
- None 
- Standard: The Player starts at 0, Moves give different points
- Vegas: The Player starts at -52 and tries to get over 0, while the deck can only be passed through one time

The Player can generate an automatic move by clicking the Hint-Button or automatically move all possible cards to the foundation by shaking the device (if it is activated in the Settings). 
Addtionally he can undo and redo moves. Optionally he is shown the time of play.

When the game is almost won (meaning that there are no more cards turned face-down), it will automatically finish.

A game is always playable (there is at least one possible move at the beginning), but not guarenteed winnable.

This App requires minimal permissions and is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group
developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.
