Which features offers Privacy Friendly Solitaire?

Privacy Friendly Solitaire provides different difficulty levels that draw either one or three cards from the deck. Additionally there are the following versions of counting points:
- None: No points are counted.
- Standard: The Player starts with zero points, moves give different points.
- Vegas: The Player starts at -52 points and tries to get more than zero points, while the deck can only be passed through one time.

The Player can generate an automatic move by clicking the Hint-Button or automatically move all possible cards to the foundation by shaking the device (if it is activated in the Settings).
Addtionally he can undo and redo moves. Optionally he is shown the time of play.
When the game is almost won (meaning that there are no more cards turned face-down), it will finish automatically.
